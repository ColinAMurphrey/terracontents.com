            <p>
              In December of 2025, I decided to go on a photography trip to Austin with my girlfriend Icey. Actually, her real name is Melody. But her past friends called her Icey. On this trip, we explored a trail in Austin near the Barton Creek Greenbelt area.
            </p>

            <p>
              While I've been on this trail before, Icey hasn't been on this trail. Despite my limited photography knowledge, I attempted to take some pictures of a nearby waterfall. I wanted to get a quick long exposure shot of flowering water (actually, this is one of the main reasons for us coming to Austin). To any personal friends reading this who are asking, "Why not just find a waterfall in Houston?" Icey and I wanted to go on a road trip to Austin. I had mentioned the idea of going on a quick, one-day road trip to Austin. She agreed, and we set out early in the morning to Austin.

              Enough yapping. Here are some of the photos I took on this trip!

            </div>

            <p>
              If you are wondering how I was able to achieve these long exposure shots, I set the aperture to f/22, the shutter speed to roughly one second, and the ISO set to 100 (change your aperture to a setting that properly exposes the image, based on your ISO and your environment).
